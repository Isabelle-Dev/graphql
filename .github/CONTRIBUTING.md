# Contributing

Hello! Thank you for taking your time to contribute!

I am relatively new to developing APIs for other developers and appreciate all the help I get!

This document's purpose is to list guidelines for how to contribute to this project. Feel free to propose your own changes through a pull request.

## Developing

If you would like to help develop, follow the steps below:

- Fork the repo
- Create your own feature branch
- Commit your changes and push to the new branch
- Open a pull request

## Bugs

Oops, bugs are unintentional (I promise!). If you find one, please open an issue with a description of what the bug is.

If possible, please also include an image of the behavior through GraphiQL.

## Feature and Update Proposals

Before you create a new [issue](https://github.com/Isabelle-Dev/graphql/issues), please check if there's already an existing one open
on the same topic. 

### Update Proposals

I use the downloadable excel data linked in the readme of the google sheets version. The downloadable file is not as
current as the actual spreadsheet itself, but I use it because it's more stable.

If there's a major change that I should address ASAP, please let me know in the issue request. Otherwise, most changes will be updated when
the stable release is ready.

### Feature Proposals

If there's something you would like to see integrated into the API, please write a feature proposal. It would be helpful if your proposal
contained the following elements:

- Describe the problem or limitation you have using the API
- Describe the feature/enhancement and how it overcomes the limitation
- Explain how your proposal works (i.e. with pseudo-code, diagrams, etc)
